# Playback

Playback is a free, open-source social platform for uploading and watching videos. Here, on Playback, users take center stage. It’s a sandbox where simplicity and community are the keys to everything. No ads. No clutter. Just you and your videos.

## Features 

### No advertisements <1>
Playback is completely against advertising. For the best user experience, ads should not appear in any form — whether in videos, on the website, or elsewhere.

### Users come first <2>
User opinions and feedback are the foundation of the platform's development. Playback is shaped by the people who use it — every feature is built with the community in mind.

### Your feed — your choice <3>
Playback users have a special privilege: the ability to customize their own recommendation feed. This feature lets you tailor content to your tastes right in your settings. 

### Adaptive and clean interface <4>
A clean and simple interface offers a layout that feels natural from the start. Users can personalize the interface to their liking, including choosing or creating their own themes, changing names, and more.
